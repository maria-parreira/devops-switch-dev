//Another key piece of a Spring Data REST application is a corresponding repository definition, as follows:

public interface EmployeeRepository extends CrudRepository<Employee, Long> { // <1>

}

/*
The repository extends Spring Data Commons' CrudRepository and plugs in the type of the domain object and its primary key
That is all that is needed! In fact, you need not even annotate interface if it is top-level and visible.
If you use your IDE and open up CrudRepository, you will find a collection of pre-defined methods.
